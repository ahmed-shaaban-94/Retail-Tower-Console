# Retail Tower Console documentation

Documentation index for Retail Tower Console, the scaffolded browser admin frontend
for Retail Tower OS. The [root README](../README.md) is the canonical entry
point; this page is the deep-dive map.

## Documentation rules

- Keep wording truthful to the current planning-first, scaffold-merged state.
- Do not imply product UI, deployment files, or future dependency changes exist
  before their approved slices.
- When referencing the slice 002 generated client, cite the Data-Pulse-2 pin
  and preserve the generated-client-only boundary.
- Treat Data-Pulse-2 as the backend and OpenAPI authority.
- Treat POS-Pulse as the terminal runtime authority.
