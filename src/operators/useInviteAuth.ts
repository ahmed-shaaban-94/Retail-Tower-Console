/**
 * createInvitation 401-disambiguation (T007, FR-005-007, OQ-1) — the
 * make-or-break rule. Grounded in `src/lib/auth-interceptor.ts:32-60`:
 * `createAuthRetry` refreshes once on a 401 and calls `onSessionLost()` ONLY if
 * the refresh itself fails; on a successful refresh it re-issues and returns the
 * retried result.
 *
 * `createInvitation` is the only RF-5 op with a *second* 401 meaning ("No active
 * tenant", a precondition — the session is still valid). We wrap ONLY that call
 * with a fresh per-attempt `createAuthRetry` instance whose injected
 * `onSessionLost` flips a local `refreshFailed` flag. After the call resolves:
 *   - non-401            → ok (the caller classifies 4xx via classifyInviteOutcome)
 *   - 401 + refreshFailed → session-expired (the ONLY sign-out path)
 *   - 401 + !refreshFailed → precondition (refresh succeeded, retry still 401)
 *                            → route to the RF-1 scope chooser, never sign-out
 *
 * The flag is local to each run (no component ref), so a prior submit's state
 * never leaks into the next (advisor: per-attempt-local). We knowingly accept
 * that a precondition-401 burns one refresh round-trip (same tradeoff as RF-2's
 * OQ-4). RF-5 owns its interceptor instance; no RF-1 modification.
 *
 * `listMembers`/`updateMembership`/`revokeMembership` document no precondition
 * 401 and use the standard wrapper; the `listMembers` active-tenant precondition
 * is guarded BEFORE the call (route to chooser when active_tenant is null).
